      description: >
        Describe in detail the exact steps that someone else can take to
        reproduce this bug using the current stable release of NetBox. Begin with the
        creation of any necessary database objects and call out every operation being
        performed explicitly. If reporting a bug in the REST API, be sure to reconstruct
        the raw HTTP request(s) being made: Don't rely on a client library such as
        pynetbox. Additionally, **do not rely on the demo instance** for reproducing
        suspected bugs, as its data is prone to modification or deletion at any time.
