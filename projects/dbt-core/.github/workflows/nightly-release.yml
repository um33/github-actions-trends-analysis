# **what?**
# Nightly releases to GitHub and PyPI. This workflow produces the following outcome:
# - generate and validate data for night release (commit SHA, version number, release branch);
# - pass data to release workflow;
# - night release will be pushed to GitHub as a draft release;
# - night build will be pushed to test PyPI;
#
# **why?**
# Ensure an automated and tested release process for nightly builds
#
# **when?**
# This workflow runs on schedule or can be run manually on demand.
